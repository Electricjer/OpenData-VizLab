# 📂 Examples

This folder contains sample visualizations submitted or created within the **OpenData VizLab** project.

Each subfolder includes:  
- The visualization file (.png, .jpg, etc.)  
- A README.md file with a description of the data, tools used, and insights (in Ukrainian and English).  

These examples can inspire you to create your own visualizations and show what is possible using open data.
