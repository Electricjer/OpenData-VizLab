Author: Jerry Love  
Dataset: https://data.gov.ua/dataset/natsionalnii-perelik-vidkhodiv

## Description
This visualization presents the distribution of waste across different chapters and subchapters in the Ukrainian National Waste List (natsionalnii-perelik-vidkhodiv). It highlights which waste categories have the most subcategories, providing an overview of the complexity of waste classification.  

Two visualizations were created:  
- Sunburst chart: showing hierarchical relationships between chapters, subchapters, and general categories.  
- Horizontal bar graph: showing the number of subchapters per chapter.  

## Methods
1. Translation: The original dataset was translated from Ukrainian to English using Grok.  
2. Data Analysis: The dataset was cleaned, sorted, and categorized in Excel.  
3. Categorization: General categories were created for each waste type to simplify visualization and highlight trends.  
4. Visualization: Charts were generated to show hierarchical relationships and subchapter distributions clearly.

## Tools used
- Excel (data cleaning, sorting, and categorization)  
- R (tidyverse: dplyr, ggplot2, readr, viridis)
- Data source: Open Data Portal of Ukraine
